 * DESCRIPTION: Write a program to simulate the simultaneous running of a collection of clocks for a period of one (1) week, where each drifts a specified amount
   of time per second.

* Old VERSION: v12.25

* New VERSION v13.25 Changes:
  - Added date functionality to ClockTime.java to keep track of day, month, and year.
    - Edited ClockTime.java to include constructors, fields and string formatted getters method to accommodate for date functionality.
    - Edited clockNames.java concrete classes displayTime methods to accommodate for date functionality.
    - Added date functionality in ClockInterface.java createCustomClocks() method to get user-defined day, month, and year.
  - Added javadoc comments to newly edited methods in clockNames.java and ClockInterface.java.
  - Edited clockNames.java methods reset() and fullReset() to include javadoc comments explaining their functionality.
  - Edited clockNames.java methods displayTime() to include javadoc comments explaining their functionality.
  - Edited ClockInterface.java methods createClocksMenu(), resetMenu(), printClocksInfoTable(), displayClocksTimes(), quitMessage(), initializeClockList(), createCustomClocks(), and isLeapYear() to include javadoc comments explaining their functionality.
  - No changes were made to the logic or functionality of the code, only documentation was added for clarity.
